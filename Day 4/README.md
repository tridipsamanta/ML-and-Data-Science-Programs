# 📊 Data Science Day 4 – Automated Analysis with Python

This project is part of my **daily data science practice series**.  
On **Day 4**, I focused on generating data, analyzing it using **pandas**, and visualizing summary statistics with **matplotlib**, all while supporting **GitHub automation**.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Each time the script runs, it:

- ✅ Generates random student study data  
- ✅ Displays all results as **pandas DataFrames**  
- ✅ Creates a **new CSV file on every run** (timestamp-based)  
- ✅ Visualizes summary statistics using **matplotlib (pyplot)**  
- ✅ Supports **GitHub Actions auto-commit**

## 🐍 Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib

## 📂 Generated Outputs

On every execution:

- 📄 A new CSV file  
- 📊 Console output as pandas DataFrames
- 📈 A bar chart showing:
- Average study hours
- Average exam score
- Correlation between study hours & exam score

---

## 📊 Sample Analysis Metrics

- Average Study Hours  
- Average Exam Score  
- Correlation (Study Hours vs Exam Score)
